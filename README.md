<br>
Thremulation Station is an approachable small-scale threat emulation and detection range. It leans on Atomic Red Team for emulating threats, and the Elastic Endpoint Agent for detection.

## Project Goals

Our goal from the very beginning has been to provide the following:

1. Lightweight range that can operate on a laptop with a _minimum_ of 4 threads and 8G of RAM
1. Support the big 3 host operating systems (initial linux path is RHEL-based)
1. Present users a smooth path to execute threats and observe them with Elastic 
1. Provide a singular TUI (Station Control) that can be used to manage all aspects
